        <p>Much like us, you have probably figured out that you are killing yourself more rapidly than most, and are now taking steps to remedy that. When we first started "trying to get healthy" we had no idea where to start. It took us weeks of searching the internet and talking with various so called "experts" to find the information we needed to start living a healthy lifestyle. This website is here to link you up with various resources on the web and in your local area to help speed up your journey to a healthy lifestyle. It is broken down into two main categories, <a href= "index.html">Nutrition</a> and <a href= "exercise.html">Exercise</a>.
